# Industrial Space Management System

## Description

The Industrial Space Management System is a project designed to enhance security and access control in industrial spaces. This system utilizes various technologies, including Arduino with ESP32CAM, MicroPython, Flask, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension.

The primary objective of this project is to improve the efficiency of managing access permissions and enhance security by accurately verifying the identity of individuals using facial recognition and RFID cards.

## Key Features

- **Access Control**: The system grants or denies access to individuals based on their authorization level, which is determined through RFID cards and facial recognition.
- **Arduino with ESP32CAM**: The project utilizes Arduino boards with ESP32CAM to capture facial images for recognition.
- **MicroPython**: The system leverages MicroPython firmware to program the ESP32 boards.
- **Flask**: The web framework Flask is used to develop the server-side application.
- **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**: The project utilizes these technologies for frontend development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The CSS framework Tailwind CSS is used for styling the web application.
- **PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB**: The project employs PostgreSQL as the database management system with the TimescaleDB extension for storing and managing data.
